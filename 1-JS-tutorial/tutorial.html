                    <h2>The HTML used for this project</h2>
                    <p>
                        The secret first step of this tutorial is: <strong>Learn basic HTML and CSS</strong>. So for this tutorial we are assuming that you already know how this works.
                    </p>                    
                    <p>
                        So, just to make it easier we've put in the necessary HTML needed, and you can do your own styling. If it doesn't make sense - go brush up on your basics.

                    <h3>Lesson 1</h3>
                    <h2>Variables</h2>
                    <p>
                        One of the first things you will have to know if you want to do anything in JavaScript is to know about variables. These may sound like complicated math terms but they’re not. Rest easy, my friend.
                        <br>Declaring a variable is how we grab certain elements from our HTML and insert it in our JavaScript so we can manipulate it. In ES6 (which is the latest iteration of JavaScript) there are multiple ways to declare a variable whereas in previous years you only had one (the <i>var</i> keyword).
                    </p>                    
                    <p>
                        Say you had made a button in HTML saying “Click me” and given it an <i>id</i> of <i>click-button</i>. To pull that button into our JavaScript, so we can manipulate it and make it do stuff when we click it, we can use two keywords; <i>let</i> or <i>const</i>. The difference in using these is we can’t reassign the value of a <i>const</i> later on as it is a constant, whereas <i>let</i> is flexible. 
                        In this tutorial we will be using a mix of both.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        To grab our <i>click-button</i> we could go:
                    </p>
                    <pre>
                        <code class="language-js">
        let ourBtn = document.getElementById(&#x2018;click-button&#x2019;);
                        </code></pre>
                    <p>It is important to know for new users that the label (name) we gave our variable could be nearly anything. In this case we called it <i>ourBtn</i> and that is how we from now on refer to our <i>click-button</i> in our tutorial.</p>
                    <p><strong>Terminology note:</strong> Later on we will be declaring variables inside the code-block of <i>functions</i>. These are called <i>local variables</i> where the ones declared outside a code-block is called a <i>global variable</i>.</p>

                    <h3>Lesson 1.5</h3>
                    <h2>A simple trick that can make alle the difference</h2>
                    <p>
                        Throughout our code, we have been using <i>$</i> like this:
                    </p>
                    <pre>
                        <code class="language-js">
        $("roll");
                        </code></pre>
                    <p>
                        This is a smart way of writing code, by decreasing the amount of code you need to write, every time you need to fetch an id from your HTML. We make the <i>$</i> into a function:
                    </p>
                    <pre>
                        <code class="language-js">
        let $ = (x) => {
            reurn document.getElementById(x);
        }
                        </code></pre>
                    <p>
                        This is our <i>$</i> function. In this function we make it return the getElementById method, one of the most used methods (which we use to fetch ids from our html), to cut down the time it takes to write it.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <i>Simple, yet effective.</i>
                    </p>
                </div> <!-- lesson3 -->

                <div id="lesson2" class="lesson">
                    <h3>Lesson 2</h3>
                    <h2>Mathematical operators</h2>
                    <p>
                        <i>“Hey! You said no math.”</i> - No, I didn’t. But luckily for us JavaScript has our backs. It has math build into it and you can use it to calculate stuff for you.
                    </p>                    
                    <p>
                        In this tutorial we will need to tell JavaScript to do some simple calculations for us.
                        <br>The operators we will need to know are:
                    </p>
                    <!-- Tabel over "math operators" -->
                    <p>
                        In our code we will use it to calculate a random number from a button click using the build-in <i>Math()</i>-method and when we cover <i>if</i>-statements to check if a value is higher or lower than something else.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Example 1</strong>
                    </p>
                    <pre>
                        <code class="language-js">
        const rollIt = (min, max) =&#x3E; {
            let rando = Math.random() * max;
            let final = Math.floor(rando) + min;
            return final;
        };
                        </code></pre>
                    <p><i>Here we used * and + to calculate variables with each other.</i></p>

        if (document.getElementById(&#x22;player1Low).checked) {
            if (arr[arr.length - 1] &#x3C; arr[arr.length - 2]) {
                console.log(&#x22;correct&#x22;);

                    <h3>Lesson 3</h3>
                    <h2>Functions</h2>
                    <p>
                        Functions is a very important part of JavaScript! Functions make the website exciting and you can manipulate everything on your website, which makes it fun and exciting. But before we can do any function I would like to declare 2 ways to store your variables.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Local variables and Global variables.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Global variables</strong> should always be declared at the top of the javascript. We only use global variables when we will use the same variable, more than one time in the javascript.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Work smarter, not harder!</strong> With global variables we can make sure we only have to write everything one time. I'll show you an example. Every time we want to get an element from the html we want to make a variable which contains the html data. We write:
                    </p>
                    <pre>
                        <code class="language-js">
        let roll = document.getElementById(&#x22;roll&#x22;);
                        </code></pre>
                    <p>
                        And if we use the function we learned in Lesson 1.5, we can simply input:
                    </p>
                    <pre>
                        <code class="language-js">
        $(&#x22;roll&#x22;);
                        </code></pre>
                    <p><br></p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Local variables</strong> are located in a function and will only be used once. The reason we write local variables is it´s easy and even easier to find again because everything that is needed is written in that function. Instead of we need to find the variables in the top everytime. But let us take a look at the function.                        
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Before we begin there is 3 different method to make a function for example:
                    </p>
                    <pre>
                        <code class="language-js">
        const rollIt = (min, max) =&#x3E; {
            &#x9;//actions
        };
                
        Function rollIt (min, max) {
            &#x9;//actions
        };
                
        Const rollIt = function (min, max) {
            &#x9;//actions
        };                      
                        </code></pre>
                    <p>
                        These functions do exactly the same, and you can start writing it however you want to. And the example, is actually the first function we need to make for the game.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>But let's break the function down so we can understand what they say – yes!</strong>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We name the function (We do that so we can call the function later). In this case we call the function “rollit”.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Between the parentheses, we call them parameters. we wrote for example “min, max”. we do that to let JavaScript scope know when to use it. In this case when we talk about minimum and maximum, so we can replace them later by a minimum number and maximum number. But many times it remains empty because the function is used when called. I will show you later how.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Between the {} is what the function should do, also called action. In this case it involves making 2 variables, which calculate a random number as described before.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        And afterward we return the result called “final”.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Let's make some magic on the website!</strong>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Now we want to show the world what we calculated. We do that by making a function, which changes the data inside the html document, let's call the function “roll”. Replace it with the result of the previous function called “rollit”. While we are at it. Why not use the new method we got from the global variable. THh code would look like this:
                    </p>
                    <pre>
                        <code class="language-js">
        const roll = () =&#x3E; {
            return $(&#x22;roll&#x22;).innerHTML = rollIt(1, 10);
        }
                        </code></pre>
                    <p>
                        Let's break it down one more time! We make a function the variable name of the function is roll. We return the element inside in the html by id “roll”. That's why we wrote “innerHtml” after that we replaced it with:/= the previous function random number between 1 and 10. - Great success!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Let's try again one more time!</strong>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Now let's make a function that reset the game.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Let's call the function “new game”. And we need to change both players' points to 0 and in the random number field. We need to make it say “roll me” like it says when you begin your game and reset the arrays to nothing so the push counts can start over again. Don't worry about how we are going to count and so on, we will do that later with the if statements. But when you have written the code, you should get something like this:
                    </p>
                    <pre>
                        <code class="language-js">

            $(&#x22;roll&#x22;).innerHTML = &#x22;Roll Me!&#x22;;
            arr = [];
        }

                    <p>
                        So the event listener is very simple! The reason we use events listeners is to make the browser look or listen at what we tell it to listen for. For example in the game we have the roll the dice when we press the button. We need our script to look after when we press it. We do that by:

                    <h2>Random Number</h2>
                    <p>
                        How to you generate a random number and what do we use it for?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In JavaScript, to get a random number between 0 and 1 we can use the function Math.random(), but in order to get a result between 1 and 10 we would have to add a couple things to a random number function.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In our game we want to use it for:
                        <ol>
                            <li>
                                Generating a random number to display as a result for rolling the dice.
                            </li>
                        </ol>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Generating a random number can be explained in two parts. Let’s start with explaining exactly what Math.random() does. Say you have some code that sets a variable to be equal Math.random() and print it out.
                    </p>
                    <pre>
                        <code class="language-js">
        let randomNumber = Math.random();
        console.log(randomNumber);&#x9;     // prints out result of randomNumber
                        </code></pre>
                    <p>The result would always equal a number between 0 and 1, as a decimal. But if we want a number between 0 and 10 we would have to multiply 10 to Math.random().</p>
                    <pre>
                        <code class="language-js">
        let randomNumber = Math.random() * 10;
        console.log(randomNumber);
                        </code></pre>
                    <p>
                        Finally, to be able to get a number between 1 and 10, we would have to add the minimum number we would want shown.
                    </p>
                    <pre>
                        <code class="language-js">
                let randomNumber = Math.random() * 10 + 1;
                        </code></pre>
                    <p>
                        However, this would also give a result above 10. In order to correct this we move on to the second part of the explanation.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The second part we will be explaining the Math.floor() function. Math.floor() returns an integer value rounded down. So say you have a variable that has a value of 10.4, Math.floor() rounds that value down to 10. We can use this on our random number to generate a number that is exactly between 1 and 10.
                    </p>
                    <pre>
                        <code class="language-js">
        let randomNumber = Math.floor(Math.random() * 10 +1);
                        </code></pre>
                    <p>
                        Wrap it all inside Math.floor() and we get a value between 1 and 10.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In our game, we can use this as a function to roll a die so it becomes easier to access and change values wherever we use it. Make a function with 2 parameters, min value and max value.
                    </p>
                    <pre>
                        <code class="language-js">
        const rollIt = (min, max) =&#x3E; {
            &#x9;let rando = Math.random() * max;
            &#x9;let final = Math.floor(rando) + min;
            &#x9;return final;
        }                                
                        </code></pre>
                    <p>
                        Now whatever we want our interval to be, is to be written inside the parameters of the function, and can be used anywhere.

                    <h3>Lesson 6</h3>
                    <h2>Arrays</h2>
                    <p>
                        How do we make an array, and what do we use it for?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Arrays in JavaScript are used to store multiple value. Arrays can store Integers, Strings and Booleans. Arrays are identified with the brackets [] symbol. We use arrays in our game to store multiple dice throw values.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In our game, we use arrays in four ways. First we use them to declare an empty array. There are two ways to declare an empty array:
                    <pre>
                        <code class="language-js">
        let arr = [];

        // or

        let arr = new Array();

        // Many programmers use the first way because it is shorter. 
                        </code></pre>
                        <p>
                            Second for adding values to the empty array. To do this we use the push method. The method push adds a new item to the end of an array. To show this we try and push some values into our array.
                        </p>
                    <pre>
                        <code class="language-js">
        arr.push(2);
        arr.push(3);
        arr.push(4);
                        </code></pre>
                        <p>
                            Now the array would have three values pushed into the array, so now the array looks like this:
                        </p>
                    <pre>
                        <code class="language-js">
        [2, 3, 4]
                        </code></pre>                                
                    <p>
                        Note that each individual value has a place in the array called indexes. Starting from 0 and increasing. So the value 2 was placed at index 0, the value 3 was placed at index 1, the value 4 was placed at index 2 and so on.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In order to store our dice values we randomly throw from the previous lesson. We could push the value that we get from the random number that is stored in our variable and push it into our array.
                    </p>
                    <pre>
                        <code class="language-js">
        arr.push(rollIt(1, 10));
                        </code></pre>
                    <p>
                        This would store a random number between 1 and 10 into our array. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Thirdly we use them for locating values in the array. In our game, we have to check whether the number generated next is higher or lower than the previous number so we have to be able to locate the last indexed value. To locate the last indexed value we can use the “length” property.
                    </p>
                    <pre>
                        <code class="language-js">
        arr.length;
                        </code></pre>
                    <p>
                        This shows the length of the array, in our previous example we had pushed 3 values into the array so the length of the array would be 3. However, there are no values located at the third index so we cannot use this is obtain the value at index 3. Therefore, in order for us to get the value at index 2, we can subtract 1 to the length of the array, and therefore have access to the very last value in the array.
                    </p>
                    <pre>
                        <code class="language-js">
        arr.length - 1;
                        </code></pre>
                    <p>
                        Lastly for emptying the array. We often want to reset arrays when we restart games. There is a very simple way to do this, and it is done in the same way as declaring an array.
                    </p>
                    <pre>
                        <code class="language-js">
        let arr = [];
                        </code></pre>

                    <h3>Lesson 7</h3>
                    <h2>if-else statements</h2>
                    <p>
                        If Else statements are a part of the programming fundamentals. Basically, they tell a statement, that “if…”, “or else…” but you can use it much more advanced than that. In our game, we want to use it to:
                    </p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            Check which player guesses correctly, give them a point and reset the turn.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Declare a winner and reset the game, so that we can play again.
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>
                        But how do we do that?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Let’s start with the first one, checking which player guesses correctly and gains a point. So why do we want to use an if else statement for this? Because it makes sense. Why make something complicated, when we can just say “If player1 guesses correctly, give them a point. Else, don’t”?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        To make this, we first make the statement.
                    </p>
                    <pre>
                        <code class="language-js">
        if ($(&#x22;player1High&#x22;).checked) {

        }
                        </code></pre>
                    <p>
                        This statement says: If player1High is checked, do something. This is the base of our if statement, because we want to be able to check if the player clicked.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We want the function to be able to check if we guessed right, which we will do so:
                    </p>
                    <pre>
                        <code class="language-js">
        if ($("player1High").checked) { 
            if (arr[arr.length - 1] > arr[arr.length - 2]) {
                console.log("correct");
                $("player1Points").innerHTML++;
            } else {
                console.log("false");
            }
        }
        if ($("player1Low").checked) {
            if (arr[arr.length - 1] < arr[arr.length - 2]) {
                console.log("correct");
                $("player1Points").innerHTML++;
            } else {
                console.log("false");
            }
        }
                        </code></pre>
                    <p>
                        In this snippet, we make an if statement within an if statement. We do this, because we want to make sure that it knows if you guessed correctly or not. We do this by making a correct or false answer which says “If(guess) is correct, give a point to player1Points innerHtml and if it’s not correct, do not give a point.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This is now our first if-else statement, which makes sure that we are able to get points if we guess correctly.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For our game, we want to be able to use these commands, when we press the roll button, so that the gameplay is smooth, and so that when we eventually do get a point, it resets so that we can use it again. We do this by wrapping it in a function, so that we can easily access it later when we need it. Let’s call it player1Turn. After our if else statement, we need to reset the players turn, which we will do by setting id”).checked = false;
                    </p>
                    <pre>
                        <code class="language-js">
        let player1Turn = () => {
            if ($("player1High").checked) {            
                if (arr[arr.length - 1] > arr[arr.length - 2]) {
                    console.log("correct");
                    $("player1Points").innerHTML++;
                } else {
                    console.log("false");
                }
            }
            if ($("player1Low").checked) {
                if (arr[arr.length - 1] < arr[arr.length - 2]) {
                    console.log("correct");
                    $("player1Points").innerHTML++;
                } else {
                    console.log("false");
                }
            }
            $("player1Low").checked = false;
            $("player1High").checked = false;
        }                            
                        </code></pre>
                    <p>
                        This is now our if else statement which we put inside a function. This checks if the player pressed the higher or lower button and decides which one is the correct one and allocates points depending on the result. We can copy this code snippet and say player2x instead of the current ids, so that we target the player 2 in our HTML.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Now we have made a function, which has if else statements in it which will determine which player determines correctly, give them a point and reset the turn. Now we need to declare a winner and reset the game. This we will do simply by saying “If player1 has 3 points, player 1 wins, or else if player 2 has 3 points, player 2 wins.
                    </p>
                    <pre>
                        <code class="language-js">
        let winner = () => {
            if($("player1Points").innerHTML == 3){
                alert("Player 1 WINS!");
                newGame();
            }
            else if($("player2Points").innerHTML == 3){
                alert("Player 2 WINS!");
                newGame();
            }
        }                            
                        </code></pre>
                    <p>
                        In the snippet above, we use an alert and call the “newGame” function. The alert is used to announce who the player is, but you will get a bit more information about that later. The “newGame” function is a function we made earlier, which sets the points to 0 and resets the roll mechanism in the game.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Lesson 8</h3>
                    <h2>Alerts</h2>
                    <p>
                        An alert is a pop-up, that appears when executed in your script. This could be used in many ways but is often used to make sure information gets properly through to the user. In our game, it would be nice to know who wins, right?  Making an alert is simple, the only code you need to write is:
                    </p>
                    <pre>
                        <code class="language-js">
        function useAlert(){
            alert("This is our alert message !");
        }                            
                        </code></pre>
                    <p>
                        Using this function with a for example a button, would trigger an alert which states “This is our alert message!”.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It looks quite simple, and we used it in our lesson about “If Else Statements” to declare who is the winner, here is the code snippet:
                    </p>
                    <pre>
                        <code class="language-js">
        let winner = () => {
            if($("player1Points").innerHTML == 3){
                    alert("Player 1 WINS!");
                    newGame();
            }
            else if($("player2Points").innerHTML == 3){
                    alert("Player 2 WINS!");
                    newGame();
            }
        }                            
                        </code></pre>
                    <p>
                        In this If else statement we simply put an alert method inside the statement, to declare who wins based on who reaches 3 points first.
                    </p>

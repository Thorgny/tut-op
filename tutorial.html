                    The secret first step of this tutorial is: Learn basic HTML and CSS. So for this tutorial we are
                    assuming that you already know how this works.
                    <br><br>
                    So, just to make it easier we've put in the necessary HTML needed, and you can do your own styling.
                    If it doesn't make sense - go brush up on your basics.

                    <h3>Variables</h3>
                </div>
                <p>
                    One of the first things you will have to know if you want to do anything in JavaScript is to know
                    about variables. These may sound like complicated math terms but they’re not. Rest easy, my
                    friend.<br>
                    Declaring a variable is how we grab certain elements from our HTML and insert it in our JavaScript
                    so we can manipulate it.<br>
                    In ES6 (which is the latest iteration of JavaScript) there are multiple ways to declare a variable
                    whereas in previous years you only had one (the var keyword).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Say you had made a button in HTML saying “Click me” and given it an id of click-button. To pull that
                    button into our JavaScript, so we can manipulate it and make it do stuff when we click it, we can
                    use two keywords; let or const. The difference in using these is we can’t reassign the value of a
                    const later on as it is a constant, whereas let is flexible.<br>
                    In this tutorial we will be using a mix of both.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To grab our click-button we could go:
                </p>
                <br>
                <pre>
                    <code class="language-js">
                        let ourBtn = document.getElementById(‘click-button’);
                    </code>
                </pre>
                <br>
                <p>
                    It is important to know for new users that the label (name) we gave our variable could be nearly
                    anything. In this case we called it ourBtn and that is how we from now on refer to our click-button
                    in our tutorial.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Terminology note:</strong> Later on we will be declaring variables inside the code-block of
                    functions. These are called <em>local variables</em> whereas the ones declared outside a code-block
                    is called a <em>global variable</em>.<br><br>
                    <strong>Pro-tip:</strong> When programming in JavaScript you will be making a variable (like above)
                    a lot. To save those precious keystrokes we'll show you a shortcut.
                    <br><br>
                    Throughout our code we have been using <em>$</em> as a shortcut for
                    <em>document.getElementById</em>.
                    <br><br>
                    Make this function at the top of your JavaScript document to bind the <em>$</em> character as the
                    shortcut.
                </p>
                <pre>
                    <code class="language-js">
                        let $ = (x) => {
                            return document.getElementById(x);
                        }

                </div>
                <p>
                    “<em>Hey! You said no math.</em>” - No, I didn’t. But luckily for us JavaScript has our backs. It
                    has math
                    built into it and you can use it to calculate stuff for you.
                    <br><br>
                    In this tutorial we will need to tell JavaScript to do some simple calculations for us.
                    <br><br>
                    In our code we will use it to calculate a random number from a button click using the build-in
                    Math()-method and when we cover if-statements to check if a value is higher or lower than something
                    else.
                    <br><br>
                    The operators we will need to know for this tutorial are:

                    <h3>Functions</h3>
                </div>
                <p>
                    Functions are a very important part of JavaScript! Functions make the website exciting and you can
                    manipulate everything on your website, which makes it fun and exciting. But before we can do any
                    function I would like to declare two ways to store your variables which we only glossed over in the
                    first lesson.
                    <br><br>
                    <em>Local variables</em> and <em>Global variables</em>.
                    <br><br>
                    <strong>Global variables</strong> should always be declared at the top of the javascript document.
                    We only use global
                    variables when we want to use the same variable more than one time in the document.

                    <em>Work smarter, not harder!</em>
                    <br><br>
                    With global variables we can make sure we only have to write said variable once. I'll show you an
                    example.<br>
                    Every time we want to get an element from the HTML we want to
                    make a variable which contains the HTML data. We write:
                </p>
                <pre>
                    <code class="language-js">
                        let roll = document.getElementById('roll');
                    </code>
                </pre>
                <p>
                    But if we use the pro-tip from earlier we can simply write the following which is an example of a
                    global variable.
                </p>
                <pre>
                    <code class="language-js">
                        $('roll');
                    </code>
                </pre>
                <p>
                    <strong>Local variables</strong> are located in a function and will only be used once. The reason we
                    write local
                    variables is that it's easy and even easier to find again because everything that is needed is
                    written in
                    that function. Instead of needing to find the variables at the top of the document everytime.

                    Before we begin breaking it down you should know that there are three different ways of writing a
                    function:
                </p>
                <pre>
                    <code class="language-js">
                        const rollIt = (min, max) => {
                            //actions
                        }

                        function rollIt (min, max) {
                            //actions
                        }

                        const rollIt = function (min, max) {
                            //actions
                        }
                    </code>
                </pre>
                <p>
                    These functions work the same way. So pick the one that makes the most sense to you.
                </p>
                <br><br>
                <p>
                    <strong>Lets break it down!</strong>
                </p>
                <br><br>
                <p>
                    We name the function - not just for looks - but so that we can call (invoke) it later.<br>
                    In this case we named it <em>rollIt</em>.
                    <br><br>
                    Between the parentheses in the function we put parameters. In this case we do <em>(min, max)</em>
                    which technically doesn't do anything on its own. But it helps us because when we call the function
                    later on by writing <em>rollIt()</em> and enter our minimum number to maximum number.
                    <br><br>
                    Between the curly brackets ({}) we write what our function should perform when called. In this case
                    we need to perform two calculations to generate a random number with JavaScript's built-in
                    <em>Math()</em> method.<br>
                </p>
                <pre>
                    <code class="language-js">
                        const rollIt = (min, max) => {
                            let rando = Math.random() * max;
                            let final = Math.floor(rando) + min;
                            return final;
                        }
                    </code>
                </pre>
                <p>
                    <em>We'll cover it in greater detail in lesson 5</em>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Lets make a function that resets the game</strong>
                    <br><br>
                    Call the function <em>newGame</em> and then we need both players' points reset to 0.<br>
                    We also want <em>roll</em> reset so it says "Roll Me!" like it did in the beginning.<br>
                    Finally we wnt our array, keeping score, reset. More on that later. For now, it should look
                    something like this:
                </p>
                <pre>
                    <code class="language-js">
                        let newGame = () => {
                            $('player1Points').innerHTML = 0;
                            $('player2Points').innerHTML = 0;
                            arr = [];
                        }
                    </code>
                </pre>

                </div>
                <p>
                    So the event listener is very simple! The reason we use events listeners is to make the browser look
                    or listen at what we tell it to listen for.<br>
                    For example in the game we have the roll the dice when we press the button.<br>
                    We need our script to look after when we press it. We do that by:
                </p>
                <pre>
                    <code class="language-js">
                        $("rollBtn").addEventListener('click', () => {
                            //And then add all functions we want to display when clicked.
                        }
                    </code>
                </pre>
                <p>
                    Just like with the function there are several ways to write an event listener:

                </div>
                <p>
                    How to you generate a random number and what do we use it for?
                    <br><br>
                    In JavaScript, to get a random number between 0 and 1 we can use the function Math.random(), but in
                    order to get a result between 1 and 10 we would have to add a couple things to a random number
                    function.
                    <br><br>
                    In our game we want to use it to generate a random number to display as a result for rolling the
                    dice.
                    <br><br>
                    Generating a random number can be explained in two parts. Let’s start with explaining exactly what
                    Math.random() does. Say you have some code that sets a variable to be equal Math.random() and print
                    it out.
                </p>
                <pre>
                    <code class="language-js">
                        let randomNumber = Math.random();
                        console.log(randomNumber);  //prints out result of randomNumber
                    </code>
                </pre>
                <p>
                    The result would always equal a number between 0 and 1, as a decimal. But if we want a number
                    between 0 and 10 we would have to multiply 10 to Math.random().
                </p>
                <pre>
                    <code class="language-js">
                        let randomNumber = Math.random() * 10;
                        console.log(randomNumber);
                    </code>
                </pre>
                <p>
                    Finally, to be able to get a number between 1 and 10, we would have to add the minimum number we
                    would want shown.
                </p>
                <pre>
                    <code class="language-js">
                        let randomNumber = Math.random() * 10 + 1;
                    </code>
                </pre>
                <p>
                    However, this would also give a result above 10. In order to correct this we move on to the second
                    part of the explanation.
                    <br><br>
                    The second part we will be explaining is the Math.floor() function.<br>
                    Math.floor() returns an integer value rounded down.<br>
                    So say you have a variable that has a value of 10.4, Math.floor() rounds that value down to 10.<br>
                    We can use this on our random number to generate a number that is exactly between 1 and 10.
                </p>
                <pre>
                    <code class="language-js">
                        let randomNumber = Math.floor(Math.random() * 10 +1);
                    </code>
                </pre>
                <p>
                    Wrap it all inside Math.floor() and we get a value between 1 and 10.

                    In our game, we can use this as a function to roll a die so it becomes easier to access and change
                    values wherever we use it. Make a function with 2 parameters, min value and max value.
                </p>
                <pre>
                    <code class="language-js">
                        const rollIt = (min, max) => {
                            let rando = Math.random() * max;
                            let final = Math.floor(rando) + min;
                            return final;
                        }
                    </code>
                </pre>
                <p>
                    Now whatever we want our interval to be, is to be written inside the parameters of the function, and
                    can be used anywhere.

                    <h3>Arrays</h3>
                </div>
                <p>
                    How do we make an array, and what do we use it for?
                    <br><br>
                    Arrays in JavaScript are used to store multiple value. Arrays can store Integers, Strings and
                    Booleans. Arrays are identified with the brackets [] symbol. We use arrays in our game to store
                    multiple dice throw values.
                    <br><br>
                    In our game, we use arrays in four ways. First we use them to declare an empty array. There are two
                    ways to declare an empty array:
                </p>
                <pre>
                    <code class="language-js">
                        let arr = [];

                        // or
                
                        let arr = new Array();
                
                        // Many programmers use the first way because it is shorter. 
                    </code>
                </pre>
                <p>
                    Second for adding values to the empty array. To do this we use the push method. The method push adds
                    a new item to the end of an array. To show this we try and push some values into our array.
                    <br><br>
                    Now the array would have three values pushed into the array, so now the array looks like this:
                </p>
                <pre>
                    <code class="language-js">
                        arr.push(2);
                        arr.push(3);
                        arr.push(4);

                        console.log(arr);
                        //printed array would be [2, 3, 4]
                    </code>
                </pre>
                <p>
                    Note that each individual value has a place in the array called indexes. Starting from 0 and
                    increasing. So the value 2 was placed at index 0, the value 3 was placed at index 1, the value 4 was
                    placed at index 2 and so on.
                    <br><br>
                    In order to store our dice values we randomly throw from the previous lesson. We could push the
                    value that we get from the random number that is stored in our variable and push it into our array.
                </p>
                <pre>
                    <code class="language-js">
                        arr.push(rollIt(1, 10));
                    </code>
                </pre>
                <p>
                    This would store a random number between 1 and 10 into our array.
                    <br><br>
                    Thirdly we use them for locating values in the array. In our game, we have to check whether the
                    number generated next is higher or lower than the previous number so we have to be able to locate
                    the last indexed value. To locate the last indexed value we can use the “length” property.
                </p>
                <pre>
                    <code class="language-js">
                        arr.length;
                    </code>
                </pre>
                <p>
                    This shows the length of the array, in our previous example we had pushed 3 values into the array so
                    the length of the array would be 3.<br>
                    However, there are no values located at the third index so we cannot use this to obtain the value at
                    index 3.<br>
                    Therefore, in order for us to get the value at index 2, we can subtract 1 to the length of the
                    array, and therefore have access to the very last value in the array.
                </p>
                <pre>
                    <code class="language-js">
                        arr.length - 1;
                    </code>
                </pre>
                <p>
                    Lastly for emptying the array. We often want to reset arrays when we restart games. There is a very
                    simple way to do this, and it is done in the same way as declaring an array.
                </p>
                <pre>
                    <code class="language-js">
                        let arr = [];
                    </code>

                    <h3>if ... else statements</h3>
                </div>
                <p>
                    <em>if ... else</em> statements are a part of the programming fundamentals. Basically, they tell a
                    statement,
                    that “if…”, “or else…” but you can use it much more advanced than that. In our game, we want to use
                    it to:
                    <br><br>
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Check which player guesses correctly, give them a point and reset the turn.</li>
                    <li>Declare a winner and reset the game, so that we can play again.</li>
                </ol>
                <br><br>
                <p>
                    <strong>But how do we do that?</strong>
                    <br><br>
                    Let’s start with the first one, checking which player guesses correctly and gains a point. So why do
                    we want to use an if else statement for this? Because it makes sense. Why make something
                    complicated, when we can just say “If player1 guesses correctly, give them a point. Else, don’t”?
                    <br><br>
                    To make this, we first make the statement:
                </p>
                <pre>
                    <code class="language-js">
                        if ($("player1High").checked) {

                        }
                    </code>
                </pre>
                <p>
                    This statement says: If player1High is checked, do something. This is the base of our if statement,
                    because we want to be able to check if the player clicked.
                    <br><br>
                    We want the function to be able to check if we guessed right, which we will do so:
                </p>
                <pre>
                    <code class="language-js">
                        if ($("player1High").checked) { 
                            if (arr[arr.length - 1] > arr[arr.length - 2]) {
                                console.log("correct");
                                $("player1Points").innerHTML++;
                            } else {
                                console.log("false");
                            }
                        }

                        if ($("player1Low").checked) {
                            if (arr[arr.length - 1] &lt; arr[arr.length - 2]) {
                                console.log("correct");
                                $("player1Points").innerHTML++;
                            } else {
                                console.log("false");
                            }
                        }
                    </code>
                </pre>
                <p>
                    In this snippet, we make an if statement within an if statement. We do this, because we want to make
                    sure that it knows if you guessed correctly or not.<br>
                    We do this by making a correct or false answer which says “If(guess) is correct, give a point to
                    player1Points innerHtml and if it’s not correct, do not give a point.
                    <br><br>
                    This is now our first if-else statement, which makes sure that we are able to get points if we guess
                    correctly.
                    <br><br>
                    For our game, we want to be able to use these commands, when we press the roll button, so that the
                    gameplay is smooth, and so that when we eventually do get a point, it resets so that we can use it
                    again. We do this by wrapping it in a function, so that we can easily access it later when we need
                    it. Let’s call it player1Turn.<br>
                    After our if else statement, we need to reset the players turn, which we will do by setting
                    id”).checked = false;
                </p>
                <pre>

                                    console.log("false");
                                }
                            }

                            $("player1Low").checked = false;
                            $("player1High").checked = false;
                        }

                <p>
                    This is now our if else statement which we put inside a function. This checks if the player pressed
                    the higher or lower button and decides which one is the correct one and allocates points depending
                    on the result. We can copy this code snippet and say player2x instead of the current ids, so that we
                    target the player 2 in our HTML.
                    <br><br>
                    Now we have made a function, which has if else statements in it which will determine which player
                    determines correctly, give them a point and reset the turn. Now we need to declare a winner and
                    reset the game. This we will do simply by saying “If player1 has 3 points, player 1 wins, or else if
                    player 2 has 3 points, player 2 wins.
                </p>
                <pre>
                    <code class="language-js">
                        let winner = () => {
                            if($("player1Points").innerHTML == 3) {
                                alert("Player 1 WINS!");
                                newGame();
                            } else if($("player2Points").innerHTML == 3) {
                                alert("Player 2 WINS!");
                                newGame();
                            }
                        }

                <p>
                    In the snippet above, we use an alert and call the “newGame” function. The alert is used to announce
                    who the player is, but you will get a bit more information about that later. The “newGame” function
                    is a function we made earlier, which sets the points to 0 and resets the roll mechanism in the game.

                    <h2 id="lesson8">Lesson 8</h2>
                    <h3>Alerts</h3>
                </div>
                <p>
                    An alert is a pop-up, that appears when executed in your script. This could be used in many ways but
                    is often used to make sure information gets properly through to the user. In our game, it would be
                    nice to know who wins, right? Making an alert is simple, the only code you need to write is:
                </p>
                <pre>
                    <code class="language-js">
                        function useAlert(){
                            alert("This is our alert message !");
                        }  
                    </code>
                </pre>
                <p>
                    Using this function with a for example a button, would trigger an alert which states “This is our
                    alert message!”.
                    <br><br>
                    It looks quite simple, and we used it in our lesson about “If Else Statements” to declare who is the
                    winner, here is the code snippet:
                </p>
                <pre>
                    <code class="language-js">
                        let winner = () => {
                            if($("player1Points").innerHTML == 3) {
                                alert("Player 1 WINS!");
                                newGame();
                            } else if($("player2Points").innerHTML == 3) {
                                alert("Player 2 WINS!");
                                newGame();
                            }
                        }               
                    </code>
                </pre>
                <p>
                    In this <em>if ... else</em> statement we simply put an alert method inside the statement, to
                    declare who wins based on who reaches 3 points first. We put in the newGame() to call on our
                    reset-function.

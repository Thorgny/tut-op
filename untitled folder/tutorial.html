                        <h3>The HTML base</h3>
                    </div>
                    <p>
                        One of the first things you will have to know if you want to do anything in JavaScript is to know about variables. These may sound like complicated math terms but they’re not. Rest easy, my friend.<br>
                        Declaring a variable is how we grab certain elements from our HTML and insert it in our JavaScript so we can manipulate it.<br> 
                        In ES6 (which is the latest iteration of JavaScript) there are multiple ways to declare a variable whereas in previous years you only had one (the var keyword).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Say you had made a button in HTML saying “Click me” and given it an id of click-button. To pull that button into our JavaScript, so we can manipulate it and make it do stuff when we click it, we can use two keywords; let or const. The difference in using these is we can’t reassign the value of a const later on as it is a constant, whereas let is flexible.<br>
                        In this tutorial we will be using a mix of both.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        To grab our click-button we could go:
                    <br>
                        let ourBtn = document.getElementById(‘click-button’);
                    <br>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It is important to know for new users that the label (name) we gave our variable could be nearly anything. In this case we called it ourBtn and that is how we from now on refer to our click-button in our tutorial.
                    </p>
                    <p id="note">
                        <strong>Terminology note:</strong> Later on we will be declaring variables inside the code-block of functions. These are called <em>local variables</em> whereas the ones declared outside a code-block is called a <em>global variable</em>.
